CAPTIONS:
Hello, my name is Michael Giorgi. I am the lead programmer of Cavelight Studios. 

We are developing a Fps/Mystery/Horror game where the players objective is to explore and uncover the secrets of a hidden facility underneath an old hotel

We will be using CG to create a toon shader as well as an inked line shader to create a visual style somewhere between an Archer comic and the borderlands series. We will be implementing Specular, and Toon ramp, as well any other Illumination fields we find thats fits or enchances the style. We will also be implementing fog, particles, ambient occlusion, shadows and bloom. Another feature I would like is a lensflare effect that is also affected by the Toon shader and/or the ink lines shader.

I will be attempting to implement the majourity of this my self as I am the only memeber of my group in this class.

I belive that throughout this course I will be able to develop all of these CG features, and implement them in a non-performance intensive mannor, to keep the game smooth and playable.
